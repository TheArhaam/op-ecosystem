    question: 'Why am I being asked to complete KYC with Optimism?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Everyone who receives grants from the Optimism Foundation and some
        business collaborators must complete KYC (or KYB, for businesses).
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'We donâ€™t have a legal entity. How can we complete KYC?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Individuals and DAOs without a legal wrapper can still complete KYC.
        Please go to {kycFormLink} and start the process to identify who on your
        team must complete KYC.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'I am part of a DAO. Can I complete KYC for the project?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Everyone who has control over the grant needs to KYC. This includes
          individuals and businesses who may participate in your DAO.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'We have a multisig wallet. Does everyone have to KYC?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. Any signer on the wallet where the grant will be sent must complete
        KYC, or KYB if they act in a professional capacity on behalf of a
        business entity.{' '}
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      'We have a Gnosis Safe. Does everyone who can vote on proposals need to KYC?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Yes. Anyone who has control over the grant, even partially, must
          complete KYC/KYB.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gnosis Safes are not recommended for the purposes of your OP grant or
          delegation, but if you intend to use a wallet with multiple signers or
          voters, these must be declared. Declaration of your wallet ownership
          structure is done at the time you complete a form at
          {kycFormLink}.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'I already completed KYC/KYB. Do I have to do it again?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Not if you passed KYC within the last year. We consider your KYC/KYB
          to be clear for 1 year following the approval date.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you will be using a new L2 wallet that we have not yet used for a
          grant, you will need to complete the form at {kycFormLink} for your
          new wallet.
        </p>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'I received more than one grant. Do I have to KYC for both?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        You only need to complete KYC one time, and your clearance is good for 1
        year from completion. If you use different wallets for each project,
        please fill out {kycFormLink} for each wallet. Please note, each grant
        must be directed to a single wallet.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I be the one to KYC on behalf of my organization?',
    answer: (
      <p>No. We need to KYB the organization that is receiving the grant.</p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'I tried to complete KYC but failed. What should I do?',
